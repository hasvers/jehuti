DISCLAIMER:

This engine is currently in development by Adam Hasvers, and neither officially released nor supported
(although I welcome bug reports at adam.hasvers@free.fr or via github)
Please do not redistribute it, any asset or any derivative work without including this file.


The engine makes use of:

Pygame (LGPL License)
NetworkX (BSD License)
Numpy (BSD License)
PyInstaller pyinstaller.org which does not constrain the license of the product.
Various shaders and bits of code whose authorship is reported in their respective source files (public domain)

Texts for the corresponding licenses are present in the gen/ directory.

Everything else falls under the MIT License (same directory) which is, as far as I know, compatible with all the previous. 

Without enforcing it, I strongly encourage improvements to be redistributed freely and modified versions to be labeled as such to avoid confusion and maintenance problems.
